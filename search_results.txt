#1. Spectral plots and the representation and interpretation of biological
  data
Similarity: 0.449
Abstract:   It is basic question in biology and other fields to identify the char-
acteristic properties that on one hand are shared by structures from a
particular realm, like gene regulation, protein-protein interaction or neu- ral
networks or foodwebs, and that on the other hand distinguish them from other...

#2. Statistical analysis of weighted networks
Similarity: 0.423
Abstract:   The purpose of this paper is to assess the statistical characterization of
weighted networks in terms of the generalization of the relevant parameters,
namely average path length, degree distribution and clustering coefficient.
Although the degree distribution and the average path length admit
str...

#3. Mixed membership stochastic blockmodels
Similarity: 0.413
Abstract:   Observations consisting of measurements on relationships for pairs of objects
arise in many settings, such as protein interaction and gene regulatory
networks, collections of author-recipient email, and social networks. Analyzing
such data with probabilisic models can be delicate because the simpl...

#4. Quantifying social group evolution
Similarity: 0.411
Abstract:   The rich set of interactions between individuals in the society results in
complex community structure, capturing highly connected circles of friends,
families, or professional cliques in a social network. Thanks to frequent
changes in the activity and communication patterns of individuals, the
as...

#5. Growing Directed Networks: Estimation and Hypothesis Testing
Similarity: 0.383
Abstract:   Based only on the information gathered in a snapshot of a directed network,
we present a formal way of checking if the proposed model is correct for the
empirical growing network under study. In particular, we show how to estimate
the attractiveness, and present an application of the model present...
